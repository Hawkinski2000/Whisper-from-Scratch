# Whisper-from-Scratch
This project is a reimplementation of OpenAI's voice transcription model, [Whisper](https://openai.com/index/whisper/), from scratch, using a modified version of [Andrej Karpathy's reproduction of GPT-2 (124M)](https://github.com/karpathy/build-nanogpt 'build-nanogpt'). Some components of the Whisper model code are directly used from the [official Whisper repository by OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/whisper/tree/main).

This project is an independent reimplementation and is not affiliated with or endorsed by OpenAI.
